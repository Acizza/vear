# vear

Vear is a program to **v**iew, **e**xtract, and (eventually) mount **ar**chives in a TUI interface that is heavily inspired by [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

It is currently in its early stages, and only supports viewing zip archives at the moment.

# Usage

Simply launch the program with the path of the archive you want to view.
